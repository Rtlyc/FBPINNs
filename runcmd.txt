Dear Professor,

I am writing to express my regret in regards to the second homework assignment. I completed Lab 2 individually, however, I made a wrong decision sending my code to another classmate. I understand this is a serious issue, and I deeply regret it. I would never allow this to happen again.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in your office hour on Tuesday.  Again, I am truly sorry for my actions.

Best,
Yuchen Liu
